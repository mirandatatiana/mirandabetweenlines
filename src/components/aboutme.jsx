            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-900 lg:text-xl">Miranda Between Lines was born because I have a lines tattoo and I love coding (coding lines)
<br />Originally from Argentina, I've made the Netherlands my home.
My professional journey has seen me grow both as a Front-End Developer and a Product Owner during my time at Accenture, where I thrived in a collaborative enterprise environment.
<br /> My expertise extends to product management, where I'm well-versed in Agile methodologies. Crafting user stories and conducting backlog grooming are some of the key aspects of my role. In the realm of UX/UI design, <br /> I'm passionate about creating intuitive interfaces, from wire-framing to usability testing, utilizing tools like Adobe XD and Figma.
Fluent in English (C1), Spanish (Native), and Italian (B1),<br /> I excel in cross-cultural communication, enriching collaborative endeavours with diverse insights. 
As a global citizen, I embrace diversity and thrive in environments where innovation flourishes through collaboration and inclusion.</p>
